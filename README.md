Introduction:
"YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL, MongoDB and Streamlit in Data Science" project, I am thrilled to delve into the realm of extracting, storing, and visualizing insights from one of the most influential platforms on the internet: YouTube
In this project, I will explore the vast landscape of YouTube data, tapping into its rich repository of videos, engagement metrics, and audience behaviors. By harnessing the power of APIs and data harvesting techniques, I aim to collect a diverse range of data points, including views, likes, comments, and user interactions.

Data Collection: 
Utilize YouTube's API to gather a comprehensive dataset including video metrics such as views, likes, comments, and user engagement data.

Data Transformation: 
Process and transform the harvested data to fit the schemas of both SQL and MongoDB databases, ensuring compatibility and efficiency in storage.

Data Warehousing: Implement storage solutions using SQL and MongoDB databases to organize and manage the harvested YouTube data effectively. SQL databases will provide structured storage for relational analysis, while MongoDB will offer flexibility for unstructured or semi-structured data.

Dashboard Creation: Develop an interactive dashboard using Streamlit to visualize the YouTube data in a user-friendly and accessible manner. The dashboard will allow stakeholders to explore insights, trends, and patterns within the data through dynamic visualizations and custom queries.

Insight Generation: Analyze the stored data to extract meaningful insights into YouTube content performance, audience engagement, and emerging trends. These insights will inform content creators, marketers, and decision-makers in optimizing their strategies for success on the platform.

Learning and Skill Development: Gain hands-on experience in data harvesting, warehousing, and visualization technologies, including APIs, SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit. Develop proficiency in data science methodologies and tools through practical application in a real-world project scenario.
